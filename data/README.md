## Data Files

### [database.csv](https://sdsna.github.io/lancet-covid-19-database/data/database.csv)

This is the full database including all indicators. Each row in the database consists of a country and a date. The row contains all available observations for the country on that date.

To open the database in Stata, run:

```stata
import delimited using database.csv, varnames(1) encoding("utf-8")
```

### [codebook.csv](https://sdsna.github.io/lancet-covid-19-database/data/codebook.csv)

This file lists the indicator IDs used in the database and indicator files.
You will find the indicator label, description, notes, source, reference, and dataset links.

### [Indicator CSV Files](https://github.com/sdsna/lancet-covid-19-database/tree/master/data/indicators/)

The `database.csv` file mentioned above contains all indicators. You can also
download data for specific indicators only. In the `indicators/` folder, you will find one CSV file for each indicator.

## Notes

1. The database is updated on a weekly basis. If you need daily updates, please reach out to finn.woelm@unsdsn.org.
1. Only countries (with 3166 ISO-3 code) have been retained. Observations for Kosovo and the Diamond Princess cruise ship, for example, have been removed.
1. Units for tests conducted vary between countries: tests performed vs people tested vs samples tested.

## Changelog

All additions, modifications, and deletions of indicators are tracked and logged
in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sdsna/lancet-covid-19-database/blob/master/data/CHANGELOG.md).
