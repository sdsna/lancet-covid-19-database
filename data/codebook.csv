(2020). COVID-19 Database of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission. Secretariat of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission. https://covid19commission.org/","Legend: (1) Suppressed, (2) Low, (3) Medium, (4) High, (5) Very High. Calculation based on sdsn_new_cases_per_million_smoothed and sdsn_positive_test_rate_smoothed. We classify a country as being in suppression if there are 5 or fewer new cases per million population per day (averaged over a rolling 14-day window), provided that the rate of testing is ample, which we define here as at least 20 tests per new case (averaged over a rolling 7-day window; the latest value is carried forward for up to 7 days to cover delays in data updates). We classify a country as having low transmission if there are 10 or fewer new cases per million population per day but the country is not in suppression. We classify a country as having moderate transmission with 10–50 new cases per million per day. High transmission is 50–100 new cases per million per day, and very high transmission is 100 or more new cases per million population per day. Before March 1st, the availability and comparability of international data on positive test rates are limited.
